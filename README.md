# **_VitaDev_**

## Read Please
#### I've seen that a couple of other people that aren't me have viewed this. That's great! Please, if you have **_any_** experience in developing for this target, **please** send me a message, I'm looking for advice and help and  I am open to suggestions. Thank you!
#### Also, the game being developed within is my attempt at a simple 2-D game remake, [Super Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid).
#### Let it be noted that my graphics library does NOT have to be used in conjunction with the game files, the game files are an extenion upon the graphics library.
#### In addition, as can be seen, I am attempting to create my own graphics libraries from scratch. **_You can use Vita2D_**, but I have opted out of this, in order to further my learning experience. This includes rendering my own file format of rgba with a header, and my own functions to draw to the screen.

#### I am open to all advice.


## Compile Instructions
#### CMakeLists.txt file is attached.
#### Ensure that your vita is unlocked. For help with setting up a development environment, read more [here](https://vitasdk.org). For unlocking the vita, read more [here](https://henkaku.xyz). For the API, read [here](https://docs.vitasdk.org).
#### Run Cmake on the current directory with ```cmake .```.
#### You may then compile the program using ```make```.
#### Using an FTP client, transfer the _.vpk_ file over.

## Assets
#### The assets seen are taken from a sprite sheet containing all sprites from the original [Super Metroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid) for the SNES. I do not claim ownership to any of the material.
